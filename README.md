## Want the OpenGL version?

There's OpenGL adaptation of this demo in the branch `opengl`.

It uses LWJGL (http://lwjgl.org) for rendering, instead of Java's
built-in Swing/AWT components.

## Building and running

The following steps are required to build and run the jar.
(An Eclipse project has been included for convenience, but the
project config may need to be adjusted to suit your environment.)

1. Build the jar: $ ant

   (ant is of course required)

2. Run the jar:

    $ java -jar GameDemo.jar

PLEASE NOTE:

I hacked this all together really fast and so things may not work
smoothly, depending on your environment and platform. I would love
to have your feedback so I can improve this.

## Game controls

Spacebar: Jump

Left arrow: Move left

Right arrow: Move right

P: Pause/unpause
